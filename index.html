						<h3 class="fragment">Mission</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Should you choose to accept</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 22px">
							So let's say you are tasked with a mission. Should you choose to accept. You're job is to break into a super secure building and steal the super secret thing that pivotal to the plot. If you were the thief, how would you go about it? Let's do this in simple movie fashion for the sake of simplicity. Well first thing, we need an alias to burn. Perfect, there's a guy for that. There always is. Then you'd need the blueprints. Gotta figure out the lay of the land. What's your plan? Well it's simple. First, you find an inside man with access and steal his credentials for access. Next you create a diversion. You phone in a bomb threat, doing all that phone routing voodoo to make sure it's untraceable. The building empties out. Perfect. Now you break in, steal the thing. But now what? You're getaway! Exactly. You're job is to make it out with the crowd, so you ditch the super secret spy clothes for a normal suit. The thing though. That needs a different route out. You hire some goons (cash). They pick up the package, and drive around town swapping cars every so often to avoid being found, and finally drop the goods off at a designated location. You pay them, burn your alias and skip town. Boom, stolen goods.

						<p>Anonymity</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">Why Linux</h3>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Open source</li>
							<li>Small footprint</li>
							<li>More secure</li>
							<li>Powerful CLI</li>
							<li>Lightweight and portable</li>
							<li>Friendlier network options</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Anonymity</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">Proxy chain</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Proxy: Middle man. Requests information your behalf and parrots it back to you.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Imagine you have a health insurance, but your friend Olly Oxenfree does not.
							- Routing calls through a bunch of different phones.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Tor &amp; VPN</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">Tor</h3>
						<p class="fragment" style="font-size: 22px">Similar to proxies, except far more advanced and secure. It encrypts all information including packet headers and sends information randomly from node to node. Each node then decrypts only the information that it needs to know where the packet came from and where it's going. Then reencrypts and sends it along.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Tor &amp; VPN</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">VPN</h3>
						<p class="fragment" style="font-size: 22px">Is a tunnel through a private server that <b>all</b> internet traffic travels through.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							- The goons were your proxy/vpn and they bounced from car to car. And let's say you only told them the location of the first car, and each car had the location of the next until you get to the end.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Anonymity</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">macchanger</h3>
						<p class="fragment" style="font-size: 22px">Media Access Control (MAC) Address. A unique identifier given to each device connected to a computer.</p>
						<p class="fragment">
							<span class="fragment highlight-red">6C:70:9F</span>:81:A7:C2
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							- First three number are manufacturer specific. The next three are unique to a machine. MAC addresses only ever make it as far as the router and are used to identify a specific machine. You can restrict access to a network by MAC address.

						<p>Infiltration</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">Footprinting and nmap</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Gathering information about a computer system and all devices and systems that it can connect to.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Reconnaissance. Allows you to map out a network. Ping sweeps, port scanning
							- Nmap is a program that allows you to do that.
							- Ransomware, web crawlers
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Infiltration</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">DOS/DDOS and Signal Jamming</h3>
						<p>Denial of Service (DOS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) is a technique of overloading a system by issuing a flurry of requests.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							- There are many ways to prevent this, the easiest is to block the IP or MAC Address. A DDOS attack attempts to subvert that.
							- Also companies and programs that offer DOS and DDOS as a service for stress testing purposes.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Infiltration</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">Reverse shell</h3>
						<p>Remote Access Tool (RAT), forces a target machine to connect to you.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Typically, you attempt to connect to a target machine, but if you cannot, you can open up a port on your system and have target machine connect to you and give you a remote shell.
							- Helps get around firewalls. Firewalls typically block access coming in, but rules for outgoing access is not as strict.
