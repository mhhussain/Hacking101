-- HACKING!
-- disclaimer: don't do anything illegal

-- Hacking 101
-- i will not be doing a demo of actual hacking. im sorry. i would have loved to, but the amount of setup required was just too much. if this presentation is received well, then ill try to set something up.
-- what i will be talking about today is the following:
    -- Definition of hacking
    -- Types of hackers
    -- Anonymity and infiltration
-- why am i doing this?
-- we often don't think about hacking as a real thing. we see it in tv shows, and to us it seems so stupid and abstract hearing "isolate the node and dump him on the other side of the router."

    -- that's not how hacking works, and it's infuriating. im hoping by the end of this, every here has a reasonable and accurate understanding of what hacking actually is, and can appreciate the subtle beauty and the terrible nature of it. really only a computer scientist is capable of understanding and appreciating the ideas used in hacking.

    -- Let's say you're planning a heist. Let's talk through how something like this would work. So let's say you want to steal money from a bank. How would you go about doing this? Well first of all, let's say you want to break in instead of robbing the place at gun point. So it needs to happen after hours. You need a couple of things. You need the schematics of the building and safe, an alias, and a ninja outfit. To get the schematics, you fake a bomb threat at City Hall. You obviously route the call through several different locations and make it short so it cant be tracked. While everyone is looking left, you go right and get the schematics. Cool. Burn one of your aliases. With the blueprints in hand, you plan out the true heist. With a new alias, you find steal the credentials of someone on the inside and use them to get through the front door.

    -- So let's say you are tasked with a mission. Should you choose to accept. You're job is to break into a super secure building and steal the super secret thing that pivotal to the plot. If you were the thief, how would you go about it? Let's do this in simple movie fashion for the sake of simplicity. Well first thing, we need an alias to burn. Perfect, there's a guy for that. There always is. Then you'd need the blueprints. Gotta figure out the lay of the land. What's your plan? Well it's simple. First, you find an inside man with access and steal his credentials for access. Next you create a diversion. You phone in a bomb threat, doing all that phone routing voodoo to make sure it's untraceable. The building empties out. Perfect. Now you break in, steal the thing. But now what? You're getaway! Exactly. You're job is to make it out with the crowd, so you ditch the super secret spy clothes for a normal suit. The thing though. That needs a different route out. You hire some goons (cash). They pick up the package, and drive around town swapping cars every so often to avoid being found, and finally drop the goods off at a designated location. You pay them, burn your alias and skip town. Boom, stolen goods.
